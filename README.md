# CNN-Based-X-ray-Morphological-Decomposition-
This Python source code and notebook introduce the CNN-Based X-ray Morphological Decomposition for Local Structures Contrast Enhancement. We highly recommend reading the related paper 'CNN-based morphological decomposition of X-ray images for details and defects contrast enhancement.' @ CVPR 2021 WiCV, for a formal presentation.
