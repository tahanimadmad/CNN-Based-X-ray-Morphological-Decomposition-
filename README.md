# CNN-Based-X-ray-Morphological-Decomposition-
This Python source code introduces The CNN-Based X-ray Morphological Decomposition for Local Structures Contrast Enhancement. We highly recommend reading the related paper 'CNN-Based X-ray Morphological Decomposition for Tone-mapping and Local Structures Contrast Enhancement.' &lt;Tahani Madmad, Nicolas Delinte &amp; Christophe De Vleeschouwer- WiCV @CVPR 2021>, for a formal presentation this tone-mapping operator.
